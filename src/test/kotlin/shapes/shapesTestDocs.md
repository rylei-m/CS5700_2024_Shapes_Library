Explanation of ShapesTests:
testGetPoints: Verifies that the points property returns a correct copy of the points list.
testMoveShape: Ensures that the move method updates all points in the shape correctly.
testArea: Confirms that the dummy area() method in MockShape returns the expected value.

Explanation of MovementTests:
PointMovementTest:

testMovePoint: Tests moving a point by positive deltas.
testMovePointNegative: Tests moving a point by negative deltas.
LineMovementTest:

testMoveLine: Tests moving a line by positive deltas.
testMoveLineNegative: Tests moving a line by negative deltas.

Explanation of LineTests:
testGetStart: Ensures that the start property returns the correct starting point of the line.
testGetEnd: Ensures that the end property returns the correct ending point of the line.
testSlope: Checks the slope calculation for a non-vertical line.
testSlopeVerticalLine: Ensures that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown when calculating the slope of a vertical line (where start.x == end.x).
testGetLength: Verifies the length calculation of the line.
testMove: Ensures that moving the line by a specified delta updates both the start and end points correctly.
