Explanation of RuleTests:
testValidShape: Verifies that the isValidShape method correctly validates a shape with at least one point and one radius.
testInvalidShapeNoPoints: Ensures that an empty list of points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidShapeNoRadii: Ensures that an empty list of radii throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testAreaCalculation: Verifies the area calculation based on the dummy implementation provided in the MockRule class.

Explanation of EllipsoidsTests:
MockRule Class: This is a mock implementation of the Rule interface used for testing purposes. It provides simple logic to validate a shape and calculate its area.
testValidEllipsoid: Verifies that a valid ellipsoid with one point and two positive radii is correctly instantiated and that the area calculation is accurate.
testInvalidEllipsoidWithZeroArea: Ensures that an ellipsoid with zero area (one of the radii is zero) throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipsoidWithNegativeRadius: Ensures that an ellipsoid with a negative radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipsoidWithMultiplePoints: Ensures that an ellipsoid with more than one point throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipsoidWithSingleRadius: Ensures that an ellipsoid with only one radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipsoidWithMultipleRadii: Ensures that an ellipsoid with more than two radii throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testMoveEllipsoid: Verifies that the move method correctly updates the position of the ellipsoid's center point.

Explanation of EllipsoidTests:
testValidEllipse: Verifies that a valid ellipse with one point and two positive radii is correctly validated and that the area calculation is accurate.
testInvalidEllipseWithZeroArea: Ensures that an ellipse with zero area (one of the radii is zero) throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipseWithNegativeRadius: Ensures that an ellipse with a negative radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipseWithMultiplePoints: Ensures that an ellipse with more than one point throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipseWithSingleRadius: Ensures that an ellipse with only one radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidEllipseWithMultipleRadii: Ensures that an ellipse with more than two radii throws an IllegalArgumentException.

Explanation of CircleTests:
testValidCircle: Verifies that a valid circle with one point and one positive radius is correctly validated and that the area calculation is accurate.
testInvalidCircleWithZeroRadius: Ensures that a circle with a zero radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidCircleWithNegativeRadius: Ensures that a circle with a negative radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidCircleWithMultiplePoints: Ensures that a circle with more than one point throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidCircleWithMultipleRadii: Ensures that a circle with more than one radius throws an IllegalArgumentException.
