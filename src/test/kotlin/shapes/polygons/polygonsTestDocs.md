Explanation of PolygonsTests:
MockRule Class: This is a mock implementation of the Rule interface used for testing purposes. It provides simple logic to validate a shape and calculate its area.
testValidPolygon: Verifies that a valid polygon with at least three points passes the validation and that the points property is correctly initialized.
testInvalidPolygon: Ensures that a polygon with fewer than three points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testAreaCalculation: Verifies that the area calculation method in the Polygons class correctly invokes the area method of the Rule interface and returns the expected value based on the dummy implementation.

Explanation of RectangleTests:
testValidRectangle: Verifies that a valid rectangle with two distinct points passes the validation.
testInvalidRectangleSamePoints: Ensures that a rectangle with identical points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidRectangleLessPoints: Ensures that a rectangle with fewer than two points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidRectangleMorePoints: Ensures that a rectangle with more than two points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testAreaCalculation: Verifies the area calculation for a simple rectangle with positive coordinates.
testAreaCalculationWithNegativeCoordinates: Checks the area calculation for a rectangle with negative coordinates.

Explanation of RuleTests:
testValidShape: Verifies that the isValidShape method correctly validates a shape with at least one point.
testInvalidShape: Ensures that an empty list of points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testAreaCalculation: Verifies the area calculation based on the dummy implementation provided in the MockRule class.
The MockRule class implements the Rule interface with minimal logic necessary to test the interface methods.

Explanation of SquareTests:
testValidSquare: Verifies that a valid square with four points forming equal width and height passes the validation.
testInvalidSquareDifferentWidthHeight: Ensures that a shape with unequal width and height throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidSquareLessPoints: Ensures that a shape with fewer than four points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidSquareMorePoints: Ensures that a shape with more than four points throws an IllegalArgumentException.

Explanation of TriangleTests:
testValidTriangle: Verifies that a valid triangle with three distinct points passes the validation.
testInvalidTriangleWithLessPoints: Ensures that a triangle with fewer than three points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidTriangleWithMorePoints: Ensures that a triangle with more than three points throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testInvalidTriangleWithZeroArea: Ensures that a triangle with zero area (all points on a straight line) throws an IllegalArgumentException.
testAreaCalculation: Verifies the area calculation for a simple right-angled triangle.
testAreaCalculationForDifferentPoints: Checks the area calculation for a triangle with different coordinates.
